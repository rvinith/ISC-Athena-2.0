Purpose: give long term overview of what our pace needs to be for the race (short term will allow us to shift the pace accordingly)

(must be able to start at any place and time)

race properties/race rules: constants/bounds that are checked

#first velocity is random

(loop this n times, have ability to change the code to vary number of simulations per loop)
(ensure a loop of loops won't kill this)

-loop:
	simulator: pass data to simulator and get race time (vector)
	score: function that rates vectors from simulations
	compare: update best scoring vector based on score
	Simulation Operator: checks if we have loop n times (and other things), and if we have met 	all conditions, output best vector found

-choose v (tbd, must be flexible): chooses velocities for next set of simulations

**simulator: input = velocity list, output = time taken**
